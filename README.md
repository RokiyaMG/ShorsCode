9-Qubits Shor's Code for Quantum Error Correction (QEC)

There are multiple limitations for quantum computing; however with quantum error correction, there could be a breakthrough in quantum computing. Shor's Code is one the famous algorihms in quantum error correction. 

# Methodology 
The steps for quantum error correction process are:
1) encoding
2) error detection
3) error recovery 
4) decoding 

There are also two types of errors in quantum computing: bit-flip error and phase-flip error. Shor's code combines the detection and recovery of both error types.
